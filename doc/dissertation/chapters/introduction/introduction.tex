\chapter{Introduction}
The following describes my part II project for the Computer Science Tripos, entitled \emph{Verified Metatheory and Type Inference for a Name-Carrying Simply-Typed \(\lambda\)-Calculus}.
The project consists of a series of machine-checked proofs about a typed \(\lambda\)-calculus, a type inference algorithm for the calculus, and a checked proof of correctness of the algorithm.

\section{Motivation}
In order to exercise my interest in formal logic and types, my supervisor suggested that I implement a typed \(\lambda\)-calculus, operations upon the calculus, and a type inference algorithm, then prove correctness properties about these.
Proofs about language semantics can include a lot of sub-cases and be difficult to argue correctly, so it was decided an automated proof-checker would be used to verify these proofs.

Therefore, the project had several principle motivations:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Produce a bug-free implementation of the calculus, operations, and type inference, encoded in a proof-checker.
\item
Ensure the implementation is correct by providing verified formal proofs with the help of the checker.
\item
Extract working code from the checker that is known to be correct.
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Computer Science}
The project draws on a wide variety of areas in Computer Science: \(\lambda\)-calculi, types, formal logic, and verified reasoning.

By implementing and verifying a \emph{typed} calculus, the project required some theory about types in addition to the \(\lambda\)-calculus, including proving properties such as the preservation of types under \(\beta\)-reduction.
Verification itself requires some knowledge (and precise application) of formal logic, as an intuitive argument will frequently not satisfy the checker.
Finally, the proof strategy taken with informal proof versus those with verified proof remain different: while theorem-proving technology has improved so that an informal proof's structure largely remains in a verified proof, details that a human reader would discount as intuitive are still often not so to the checker.

\section{Previous Work}
Clearly for such a theoretical project, much of the work involved is standing on the shoulders of giants: Church's \(\lambda\)-calculus has a distinguished history\cite{lambda-history}, as does type theory since Russell's original \emph{theory of types}\cite{russell}.
Formal verification also has a great deal of previous work that can be re-used: the majority of proof checkers are now proof \emph{assistants}, including automation tools, tactics and theorem provers (at least for small deductive steps) and large existing libraries of formalised mathematics.
As an example, the \textsc{Mizar} system\cite{mizar} contains in its distribution a library of over 50,000 proofs.

There is also more specific work that pertains directly to my project.
Several implementations of typed \(\lambda\)-calculus have been implemented and verified (see for instance the \textsc{PoplMark} challenge\cite{poplmark}) using an assortment of techniques, tools, and proofs, all of which can help with my project.

\subsection{A Note on Difficulty and Plagiarism}
Given the large amount of relevant previous work, the mildly-sceptical reader might say that my project is not particularly difficult, and the hardened sceptic would claim that it amounts to plagiarism.
I hope the examiners will recognise that the number of variables (exact details of the type system, approach to representation, tooling, proof style\ldots) provides significant scope for variation --- to the best of my knowledge, there are no existing implementations that are similar to my project in this respect.
Combining these variable factors into a project also produces sufficient difficulty for it to be as new research: all proofs were sketched first with pen-and-paper, then transcribed (in painstaking detail, as verification demands) into the proof assistant.
